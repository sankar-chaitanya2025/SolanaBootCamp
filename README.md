Hi, I’m Sankar Chaitanya.

# Blockchain Developer & Smart Contract Bootcamp

**Beginner to Expert Course**  
*Learn smart contract development and take your skills to the next level.*

Welcome to my journey through the full [Blockchain Developer Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amAq-WHAFs8). Here you’ll find all the core material, code examples, and a walkthrough of the projects I built as part of the course. This bootcamp helped me move from a blockchain beginner to building real applications on Solana.

### Who’s This For?

If you’re curious about blockchains, want to code smart contracts, or just want to see how Solana development works in practice—you’ll feel right at home. No need to be an expert in crypto or Rust before getting started. I began with just a basic programming background, and this course had everything I needed.

## What I Learned

- Why and when blockchains make sense for different apps
- How to code real-world applications on the Solana chain
- Core concepts in Rust, cryptography, and smart contracts

The idea was to start simple and finish with projects ready to show off to others—or even use as a foundation for bigger things.

### Prerequisites

- Just a laptop (Mac/Windows/Linux)
- Some general programming knowledge
- Curiosity and willingness to experiment

## Course Projects

I completed a range of hands-on projects that gradually ramped up in complexity. Here’s the list:

| #   | Project                 |
| --- | ----------------------- |
| 1   | Favorites               |
| 2   | Voting                  |
| 3   | Blinks                  |
| 4   | CRUD App                |
| 5   | Tokens                  |
| 6   | NFTs                    |
| 7   | Poker Chip Swap         |
| 8   | Token Vesting           |
| 9   | Token Lottery           |
| 10  | Lending                 |
| 11  | Programmable Money      |


Each one taught me something new—whether it was how accounts and on-chain programs work in Solana, handling tokens and NFTs, or thinking through security and deployment challenges.

### Resources That Helped Me

Whenever I got stuck, these were my go-to’s:
- [Solana StackExchange](https://solana.stackexchange.com/)
- [Solana Official Documentation](https://solana.com/docs)
- [Anchor Framework Guide](https://www.anchor-lang.com/)
- [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

You don’t have to reinvent the wheel—there’s great community support out there.

### Final Note

I built and deployed every one of these projects myself, diving deep into Solana smart contracts, the Anchor framework, and all the core pieces needed for real blockchain apps. If you try similar bootcamps, be aware these projects aren’t security-audited, so don’t use them as-is in production!

Ready to create on-chain? Go for it!
